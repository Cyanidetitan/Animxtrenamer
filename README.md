# Renamer-Bot

# Basic Overview

This is aimed to be a private renamer bot for you and your admin community.
Only one person can use the bot at a time.
This has been done to preserve the batch renaming feature.
I don't know advanced techniques to handle it all simultaneously.

/add to add other admins.
You have to provide the main admin user id, when you are entering the environment variable.
If you put unexpected items in the input, you will get unexpected output. Don't be surprised.






# Known Issues
Can't Support Batch rename with multiple users as of now

# Note
Not Stable (Use at your Own Risk)
